# Song-Bird
Song Bird Jupyter Notebook

Song Bird will help save users time and effort by suggesting similar songs by an artist based on the one song already obtained from the artist.

Finding new music that fits your taste is a difficult and complicated task that companies like Apple, Spotify, and Pandora are always chasing to perfect. We will focus on a small problem within that larger task. Our problem is hearing a song that you love by an artist you don’t know for the first time. You manage to fumble your phone out of your pocket and open the Shazam app as the song begins to end. You pray that the Shazam bubble recognizes the song before the final note. Score! You have a new song in your library by an artist you are unfamiliar with. Again, if you’re anything like me, your next question is, Ok, what else will I like by DJ David? You might flip to his Apple music page and see DJ David has 100 songs and 4 albums. You start at the most liked songs… well those don’t sound anything like the song I liked and I don’t have time to go through all 100 songs.
